# TeamHNJ

This is the group project for our Java class. We are building a simple program that takes customers' orders and processes them.

This project demonstrates our knowledge of, appreciation for, and love for object-oriented programming.

More advance iterations of this project might include accepting payments and updating store inventory. We will see if we get that far.
