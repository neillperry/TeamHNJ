# TeamHNJ

This is the group project for our Java class. We are building a simple program that takes customers' orders and processes them.

This project demonstrates our knowledge of, appreciation for, the principles of object-oriented programming.

## Phases of Development

Originally, we envisioned a basic product that we might expand depending on time and technical skills.

- Phase 1 - (Minimum Viable Product):
Order a simple meal from a fast food restaurant (burger, fries & drink). Program displays prices, taxes, and total order cost. 

- Phase 2:
When taking the order, assign an order number to the order and associate the customer’s name to that order (“Bob” has order 849). 

- Phase 3: 
Customize order (no pickles, extra mustard, well done) & order different sized-drinks / fries (large, medium, small) 

- Phase 4: 
Order from a GUI that displays the order, taxes, and total cost 

- Phase 5: 
After user confirms order a timer displays on GUI interface that counts down when order is ready 

- Phase 6: 
Update the store inventory with each order 

## Current and Future Status
At the end of the week, we were able to accomplish almost all phases. We decided against customizing orders (Phase 3) due to increased complexity. 

Also, we took care to create and run unit tests throughout development. 

In the future, we would need to create integration tests as well as create tests for the UI. Also, if we had time, we might create a separate UI for the Store so that the Store Manager could monitor Inventory status.
